         She is an actress, turned Wax Specialist, turned Software Engineer. Pariss learned to code and got her first job as a Software Engineer in 2017. In 2018, she was laid off from that job and tried to find a new role. She decided to get onto Twitter to tweet about her journey finding a job in tech, and vent about the trials and tribulations of what it's like to be the only Black person at a company. A couple of months in, she discovered that there was a very small community of Black technologists, which was shocking because up until that point, she honestly believed there were just no Black people in tech. She never worked with someone who looked like her, and she rarely saw many Black people at conferences or meetups I'd attend. Out of shock and curiousity, she put out a tweet asking, 'What does Black Twitter in tech look like?'. She didn't expect anything to come from that tweet since I was so new to the Twitter platform and barely had a following, but the complete opposite happened. Her phone began vibrating non-stop with responses to my tweet. Black technologists from all over the world were responding to the tweet, which created a super long thread of their selfies with captions of what they do in the industry. It was surreal, but that's the power of social media!
